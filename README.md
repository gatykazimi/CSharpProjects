## Foundational C# with Microsoft (freeCodeCamp)
These projects were from completing the Microsoft Foundational C# Certificate program. The challenge projects I completed are inside the starter folder within each challenge project 
(eg. CsharpProjects/Challenge-Project-variable-data-in-CSharp-main/Starter). The other two folders Debug101 and ThrowExceptions101 contain practice files where I learned how to debug using VS code's builtin
debugging programs and how to throw exceptions.
